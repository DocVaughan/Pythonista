Part 4 -- Coins! ðŸ’°

Now that our alien can run around, let's add a bit of an incentive to do so... What could be a better motivation than gold raining from the sky?

As before, you'll find detailed explanations about the changes in this part directly in the code. Use the popup menu to navigate to the numbered sections.
